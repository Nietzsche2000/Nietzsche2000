### Hello 🌎, Welcome to Monish's Github page. 

I am an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley 🐻, where I simultaneously major in **Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS)** 💻 and **Mathematics** 🧮. 
My focus lie in the intersection of *High Performance Distributed Computing*, *Large-Scale Machine Learning*, and *High Dimensional Statistics*.

Here are some of my work highlights:
* [Nietzsche2000Map-Reduce-Distributed-Computing](https://github.com/Nietzsche2000/Map-Reduce-Distributed-Computing) - Map Reduce using gPRC, a fully functioning map reduce system for clusters of computers. 
* [Nietzsche2000/TensorTrainALG](https://github.com/Nietzsche2000/TensorTrainALG) - Advanced Tensor Operations: tensor train algorithms and tensor compression. For use in high dimensional data compression and speeding up inferences in Large Neural Network Models.
* [Nietzsche2000/Day-Schedule](https://github.com/Nietzsche2000/Day-Schedule) - Day Scheduler is a Python application designed to organize and vocalize daily tasks.

🔭 Currently, I work on algorithms to ***compress large neural network models*** to reduce inference time and for efficient training. Previously, I worked in ***neural network theory***--mathematical formalism of neural networks, and in ***optimization models***.

Feel free to reach out to me at monishwaran@berkeley.edu if you want to discuss more about my interests or potential collaborations.
